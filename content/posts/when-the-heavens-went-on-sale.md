* Almost always the same pattern of success: Enjoy you work, be curious, work hard, learn a lot, don't be satisfied with "okay" or "good", have an internal drive to perfectionism and to produce great work.

> "To meet his own exacting standards, Marshall developed a spreadsheet system for quantifying various aspects of his life, which his friends called the **Marshall Matrix**. The prime motivation for the spreadsheets came from Marshall's desire to analyze which of his actions would have the most impact on the world and the betterment of all people. He literally wrote an algorithm designed to result in a meaningful life. As he described it, '"Basically, you list your goals. You list each project and say, 'How does this project help goal number one, how does it help goal number two?'Then 'What's your probability of success? How much money and time will it take?' You divide by that factor, then you multiply by a series of other factors. "I tried to factor in things that you usually miss, like your abilities as compared to other people or, say, difference in participation. Like, is someone else going to do this anyway even if you don't? If so, you should reduce the weight of that project. There were other things like your level of interest or how much work something would be." (p. 79)

People working in space companies are space addicts. They talk about space nonstop, not just at work:

> "...but at night they pondered those questions with friends at the Rainbow Mansion. Marshall, being Marshall, tried to add some rigor to the pondering by creating a spreadsheet that collected and ranked people's ideas." (p.97)

> As on most days, they talked about aerospace nonstop -- not really because they were in the midst of trying to launch a rocket but because they were aerospace obsessives.


We always think that \<INSERT BIG COMPANY HERE\> is lightyears ahead of everyone else, so why even bother making a startup. The big guys with their resources and years of experience are so much better suited to make <\INSERT INNOVATIVE PRODUCT HERE\>. But that is often not the case. With size comes lethargy.And with experience comes the reluctance to try out new things: You spent years optimizing process X, so why try a new one? The book shows that even presumably innovate companies like NASA lack innovation and a spirit to innovate:

> "NASA was meant to be so many steps beyond anything else, and it just wasn't. People were complaining that they didn't have decent computers"

> "The problem was, however, that the cutting edge didn't seem to exist. Whether at a company or even NASA, everyone did things the same old way, and these people doing things the same old way didn't seem to have much passion. No one really appeared to have new ideas or want to advance aerospace technology."

> "Beck felt more and more convinced that the aerospace industry had become complacent and fearful as the decades had passed.**A small team with limited resources could accomplish an awful lot if it just thought about problems in inventive ways.**"

> "Beck enjoyed his job so much that Fisher & Paykel could not keep him out of the building. He'd clock in early in the morning and often not leave unil 3:00 a.m."

> "Ever the engineer, he broke down what he needed to do next into a series of steps: Start a company. Raise some money. Build something small first. Gain confidence. Then build something bigger. Raise more money. Just having a plan erased Beck's anguish and pumped him to the brim with enthusiuasm." (When the Heavens went on Sale, p.176)

> "Looking to perfect his rocket engine technology, Beck read the classics of the field, like *Rocket Propulsion Elements* by George P. Sutton and Oscar Biblarz. He also mined the internet for scientific papers and took advantage of NASA's rather generous archives of technical documentation and manuals. The more he read and the more he experimented with the propellants, the more comfortable Beck became with the idea of making something real." (When the Heavens went on Sale, p.162)

> "Like a man posessed, Beck began building his first rocket. The project required that he once again experiment with propellants. This time around it was not so much about refining the chemicals as finding the right recipe of explosives to combine. Knowing almost nothing about chemistry, he read books on the subject and sought advice from anyone who could help, including scientists working down the hallway." (When the Heavens went on Sale, p.181)

> [Peter Beck:] "I've since learned that I should times everything by pi. The amount of time and cost is usually about 3.14 times what you think it will be."

> Rockets are not supercomplicated. If it looks complicated, it's because you haven't broken it down into enough chunks yet. The key to building a rocket is breaking it into tiny little chunks (p. 313)

Relentless passion of all employees, because they were all space addicts:

> One thing that I hammer home to all of you every week is 'work smart' and the second thing is 'get back to work'

> „That said, there are fifty-six companies saying they're going to build small rockets right now. I know most of them. I would say Stealth Space is the most legit in the US.“ (p. 293)
