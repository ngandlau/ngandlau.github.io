* Vaclav Smil calculates everything in diesel-equivalents. Advantage: easy to visualize a liquid. Disadvantage: the production of anything energy-intensive looks dirty, yet the "dirtyness" depends on the source of energy (energy can come from renewables or fossil fuels).
* Feeding a chicken takes 3kg grain. The production of grain requires 50-150 ml diesel-equivalents per kg grain, depending on where it is produced. Additional transportation can add up to +700 ml diesel-equivalent per kg of transported good(?). Thus, feeding a chicken until it is slaughtered requires an input of `3kg*50ml/kg + 0 ml = 150ml` to `3kg*150ml/kg + 600ml = 1050ml` diesel-equivalent. 
In the last 50 years, the amount of feed needed per unit of live broiler (HÃ¤hnchen) went from 3 units to 1.82 units (~half).
