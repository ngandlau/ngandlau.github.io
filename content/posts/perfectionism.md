Interviewer: "Was ist ihre größte Schwäche?" Antwort: "Ach ich bin einfach zu perfektionistisch." 

**Ist Perfektionismus wirklich eine Schwäche?**

Hier ist eine Sammlung von Anekdoten, in denen Perfektionsmus ein Faktor für den Erfolg ist.

* Jiro Ono is a perfectionist in its purest form, and because of that he serves the best sushi of the world: *"Even at my age, after decades of work, I don't think I have achieved perfection...I do the same thing over and over, improving bit by bit. There's always a yearning to achieve more...Ultimate simplicity leads to purity" --  "He is never satisfied with his work...He is always trying to find ways to make the sushi better or to improve his skills"* (source: the documentary [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi))

* Peter Beck, Founder of Rocket Lab, during a speech to his employees: *"We go to space to help people on Earth, which is superimportant. It's also important to me that we build beautiful things. I don't care if it's a spreadsheet or a valve for a rocket -- make everything you do beautiful. You'll notice that every component on that Rocket is just beautiful. The reason why I put so much emphasis on that is that if someone has taken the time to make it beautiful, it generally works. And it's not just with components. Take that little bit of extra time to format the spreadsheet and change the fonts, and don't use horrible colors that don't match. Just make it look beautiful. That's really important to me."* (source: [When the Heavens went on Sale by Ashlee Vance, p. 237](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56246243-when-the-heavens-went-on-sale))

* Steve Jobs, while working at NEXT, insisted that the Cube computer should be exactly 12x12x12, yet it would cost half as much if it were 12x12x13 (source: [Lex Fridman Podcast #386 -- Marc Andreesen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hxeDjAxvJ8&t=903s)). 

* If you make something beautiful, you increase the likelihood of it being correct and well-engineered. The underlying philosophy is that aesthetics are not just appearances but have a deep underlying meaning. In mathematics, you sense that a proof is correct when the proof itself is beautiful.
